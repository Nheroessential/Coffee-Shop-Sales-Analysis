This guided project gives us access to a rich dataset that is ready for investigation, sourced by [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?pageSize=10&search=coffee+shop+sales). One excel sheet with transaction records for Maven Roasters, a fictional coffee business with three locations in New York City—Astoria, Lower Manhattan, and Hell's Kitchen—is included in the dataset. Together with product-level information, the dataset also contains the transaction date, timestamp, and location.
